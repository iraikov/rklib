Runge-Kutta methods in Standard ML.

This library is a port of the Haskell Runge-Kutta library by Uwe
Hollerbach (http://hackage.haskell.org/package/rungekutta).  It
contains a collection of explicit Runge-Kutta methods of various
orders, some with fixed-size steps (no error estimate) and some
intended for adaptive stepsize.
